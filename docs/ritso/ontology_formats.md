# Ontology File Formats

## General

The registry for ITS ontologies (RITSO) intends to capture ontologies for ITS documented in widely accepted file formats that can be managed with a modern version control system and that can easily be translated into a website, including diagrams showing key references. The following technologies have been selected to achieve this management:

- GitHub: for version control
- Web Ontology Language (OWL): for specifying the semantics of the ontology
- W3C Turtle (*.ttl) file format: for formally specifying OWL content. Alternative formats include RDF (*.owl) and ontology functional syntax notation (*.ofn).
- The [python scripts](https://github.com/k-vaughn/ontologies/tree/main/python) developed by this registry effort: to convert the ontology files into more human-friendly source files
- GraphViz: to convert the text description of graphics into actual graphics
- Material for MkDocs: to convert the source files into a website

## Namespaces

Every ITS ontology **should** declare the following namespace prefixes:

- : (i.e., the default) typically the ontology namespace
- cc: http://creativecommons.org/ns#
- dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
- owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#
- dash: http://datashapes.org/dash# (when used)
- rdf: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
- rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
- skos: http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#
- vann: http://purl.org/vocab/vann/
- xml: http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace
- xsd: http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#

In addition, ITS ontologies **should** declare a namespace prefix for each additional ontology referenced. Even if the prefix is not used in the ontology file, declaring the prefix allows the diagrams that are generated by the python scripts to shorten the IRI to just the prefix to make diagrams more readable. The prefixes **should** use the preferred prefix for the referenced ontology (when declared) and it does not cause a conflict. Ideally, ITS ontologies should only reference ontologies already included in the RITSO.  

## Recommended Annotations

The RITSO recommends using the following annotations when describing ontologies.

| Annotation                     | Rationale and Usage Notes                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dcterms:title`                | The name of the resource.                                                                         |
| `skos:definition`              | Definition; only once per language. If not present, script uses dcterms:description as fallback.  |
| `vann:preferredNamespaceUri`   | Although shown elsewhere, this is needed for some tools to pair with the preferred prefix.        |
| `vann:preferredNamespacePrefix`| The preferred prefix to use when referring to items in this resource.                             |
| `dcterms:creator`              | Primary author; can be more than one.                                                             |
| `dcterms:created`              | Date of creation of the ontology file.                                                            |
| `owl:versionIRI`               | The version of the ontology represented by this resource using semantic versioning.               |
| `owl:priorVersion`             | The date of the official preceding version of the ontology.                                       |
| `dcterms:license`              | Identifies the legal usage terms; CC-BY 4.0 is recommended.                                       |

While the RITSO allows the use of any defined annotation, the following are recommended as preferred optional annotations to be used as appropriate for ontologies.

| Annotation                      | Rationale and Usage Notes                                                                       |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dcterms:bibliographicCitation` | Provides the textual identifier of the document that formalizes or explains this ontology.      |
| `dcterms:contributor`           | Contributor to the ontology for which credit is to be provided.                                 |
| `dcterms:issued`                | Year that the associated document was formally issued.                                          |
| `dcterms:modified`              | Identifies the date of an update date; pair with repeatable `skos:changeNote` for descriptions. |
| `rdfs:seeAlso`                  | Provides the URI of the document that formalizes or explains this ontology.                     |
| `skos:changeNote`               | Provides a description of the update date; pair with `dcterms:modified`                         |

The RITSO recommends using the following annotations when describing ontology elements (e.g., classes and properties).

| Annotation           | Rationale and Usage Notes                                                  |
