# ITS Security Regulations, Frameworks, Standards and Guidance Documents

Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) cybersecurity integrates layered regulations, frameworks, standards and policy. These documents govern how organizations manage ITS deployments and how product vendors integrate cybersecurity into product design. This page provides a high level description of how global frameworks interact with regional standards to support deployment and operation of secure ITS. ![Standards and Policies](images/standards-and-policies.jpg)

## Global Interoperability Frameworks

Global interoperability frameworks define policies or agreements that ensure cross-border operations. They are important for cross-border operations.  Today, most frameworks apply to a region, such as the European Union, North America, or Asia.  Organizations may be required to adhere to these frameworks in some instances, and in other instances may voluntarily adopt them, depending on the region that the organization operates within. 

### European Union Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)

The [European Union (EU) Cyber Resilience Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/2847/oj/eng) is a binding regulation that takes effect in the European Union from December 2024. It applies to all digital products, including ITS devices such as On-Board Units (OBUs), Roadside Units (RSUs), and Traffic Management Systems. The CRA requires that products be designed, developed, and maintained with cybersecurity as a core property throughout their lifecycle. Key obligations include:

- security-by-design
- secure default configurations
- release without known exploitable vulnerabilities
- continuous vulnerability remediation
- patching for the full operational lifetime of the product

Products must undergo conformity assessment and display a CE marking before being placed on the EU market. The CRA also mandates vulnerability disclosure processes, incident handling procedures, and supply chain security requirements. This regulation establishes a harmonized baseline of cybersecurity expectations for all ITS products used within the EU.  ISO/SAE 21434 supports compliance in the automotive/ITS domain.

### Directive (EU) 2022/2555 NIS Directive (NIS2)

[NIS2](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj/eng) requires operators of essential and digital services, which include transport and mobility operators,  to implement cybersecurity risk management measures, report significant incidents, and manage supply chain security. NIS2 addresses organizational resilience, requiring agencies, service providers, and operators to put governance and operational processes in place. NIS2 does not mandate ISO/IEC 27001 or ISO/SAE 21434 specifically, but both can serve as acceptable evidence of “appropriate and proportionate” cybersecurity measures. For example, a transportation management organization that is compliant with ISO/IEC 27001 for their organizational cybersecurity program, or an OEM that adheres to ISO/SAE 21434 for their Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) would both acceptable ways to meet the expectations described in NIS2. 

### UNECE Regulations R155 and R156

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has issued two vehicle cybersecurity regulations that apply to manufacturers placing vehicles on regulated markets.

- [UNECE R155](https://unece.org/transport/documents/2021/03/standards/un-regulation-no-155-cyber-security-and-cyber-security) requires manufacturers to implement a Cybersecurity Management System (CSMS) across the lifecycle of the vehicle, from design through post-production. It obliges manufacturers to identify threats, implement mitigations, and demonstrate compliance during type approval. ISO/SAE 21434 provides the detailed engineering processes to support this.
- [UNECE R156](https://unece.org/transport/documents/2021/03/standards/un-regulation-no-156-software-update-and-software-update) mandates a Software Update Management System (SUMS) to ensure secure and auditable software and firmware updates, including measures for authentication, integrity protection, and traceability.

Together, R155 and R156 define how OEMs and suppliers address lifecycle security in vehicles and connected ITS systems.

### ITS Directive (Directive 2010/40/EU)

[The ITS Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2010/40/oj/eng) provides the EU framework for coordinated ITS deployment and includes obligations for service providers. It enables binding delegated acts across domains such as real-time traffic information and cooperative ITS. Service providers under the Directive may be required to provide feedback when distributing ITS data and messages. This has implications for how IOOs, map providers, service providers, and OEMs structure feedback and discrepancy handling in ITS deployments

## Global Standards

Global standards provide a structured methodology for managing cybersecurity risk across organizations and supply chains. They define terminology, governance practices, risk management processes, and assurance methods that are not ITS-specific but support ITS stakeholders with understanding how to apply the standards to the ITS domain. These standards may enable stakeholders to demonstrate compliance with regulations such as the EU CRA, UNECE R155/R156, or U.S. federal guidance.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is widely adopted in North America as a risk-based approach to organizing cybersecurity activities. It is structured around six functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. The CSF guides organizations in setting cybersecurity expectations, performing risk assessments, and aligning operational practices such as patching, monitoring, and incident response. For ITS deployments, state departments of transportation, municipalities, and traffic management centers often use the CSF to structure their security programs and demonstrate alignment with national policy guidance. While the CSF provides a strong governance structure, it does not define technical requirements for ITS protocols or devices, which must be derived from sector-specific standards. 

NIST CSF 2.0 is structured hierarchically. Functions define high-level cybersecurity objectives (e.g., Govern, Identify, Protect). Each function is divided into Categories, which describe broad classes of cybersecurity outcomes (e.g,. asset management). Subcategories further refine each Category, by stating specific, outcome-oriented cybersecurity results that an organization should achieve, for example, "Inventories of hardware management by the organization are maintained".  

![](images\nist_csf.jpg)

[NIST SP 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final) then provides detailed cybersecurity and privacy requirements that can be mapped to the NIST CSF 2.0 subcategories, enabling organizations to select, implement, and assess controls that support the intended CSF 2.0 outcomes. 

#### The ITS Cybersecurity Framework Profile 

While the NIST CSF 2.0 provides a broad framework for describing cybersecurity outcomes across sectors, profiles can be used to tailor the framework to the needs of specific industries or technologies. In the United States, the ITS Cybersecurity Framework Profile has been developed to apply the NIST CSF structure to the unique environment that an ITS operates within. The ITS CSF Profile maps CSF Functions, Categories, and Subcategories to transportation-specific cybersecurity outcomes, reflecting how cybersecurity objectives should be viewed in real-world ITS deployments. 

The ITS CSF Profile provides a common cybersecurity reference point for infrastructure owner operators, system integrators, device manufacturers, and application developers.  To enable implementation, the ITS CSF Profile is used to derive device-specific cybersecurity control sets for common ITS technologies, including DMS, RSUs, ATCs, and CCTV systems. These control sets map CSF Subcategory outcomes to the unique operational and risk characteristics of each device type, supporting consistent, cybersecurity implementation by stakeholders developing, operating and maintaining each of these specific technologies. 

### ISO/IEC 27001

[ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:27001) is an international standard for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It requires organizations to identify risks, implement controls, and continuously improve security posture through audits and reviews.  For IOOs, compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 provides assurance to regulators and partners that the organization is managing security in line with global best practices. Like the NIST CSF, it does not address ITS-specific requirements but it provides a foundation for mapping of ITS security standards to specific cybersecurity features and functions. Certification to ISO/IEC 27001 demonstrates that an organization has implemented structured governance over information security, including:

- Access control
- Supplier and third-party management
- Asset and configuration management
- Auditing and continuous improvement

In Europe, although ISO/IEC 27001 is not formally required under the CRA, it provides a recognized way for organizations to demonstrate compliance with obligations around risk management.

### ISO/SAE 21434

[ISO/SAE 21434](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-sae:21434) establishes detailed engineering practices for automotive and ITS cybersecurity by defining lifecycle processes that begin with threat analysis and risk assessment and extend through secure design, development, and supplier coordination. The standard also emphasizes the importance of validation, post-production monitoring, and incident response, ensuring that security is treated as an ongoing responsibility rather than a one-time exercise. It is recognized globally as the engineering benchmark for demonstrating compliance with UNECE R155, providing manufacturers with a structured method to show that cybersecurity has been embedded into every stage of the vehicle and ITS product lifecycle.

In Europe, ISO/SAE 21434 is not formally required under the CRA but provides a recognized way for automotive and ITS manufacturers to demonstrate secure-by-design practices and lifecycle risk management, supporting compliance with both CRA and UNECE R155.

## National and Local Policies

National and local governments are responsible for translating global frameworks and standards into enforceable requirements within their jurisdictions. These policies define how international obligations are applied in practice, shaping procurement rules, oversight mechanisms, and operational compliance for agencies, manufacturers, and operators.

In the United States, federal and state agencies frequently use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the NIST SP 800-53 control catalog as the foundation for transportation cybersecurity programs. For ITS deployments, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed ITS Security Control Sets that tailor NIST controls to devices such as traffic signal controllers, roadside units, and transportation management systems. These control sets provide Infrastructure Owner-Operators (IOOs) with prescriptive guidance on configuring devices, enforcing access control, and ensuring compliance with national cybersecurity objectives. They are also being used as templates for training materials and deployment guidance across state and local agencies.

In the European Union, national authorities use conformity assessments to verify compliance with binding regulations such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and UNECE Regulations R155 and R156. Products must meet these requirements before they can be marketed or deployed. Manufacturers may adopt ISO/IEC 27001 to structure their organizational security programs and demonstrate that governance practices align with NIS2 obligations, while product-level compliance is verified through the CRA and UNECE mechanisms. The C-Roads Initiative has also developed Protection Profiles for ITS devices (for example, the RSU Gateway PP BSI-CC-PP-0122, 2024), which provide reference security targets for evaluation.

### Certificate Policy (CP) and Certificate Practices Statements (CPS)

While organizational frameworks such as ISO/IEC 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, or the EU Cyber Resilience Act provide general requirements for governance and risk management, CP and CPS documents translate those high-level obligations into PKI-specific trust rules. They ensure that certificate authorities, enrolment authorities, and authorization services operate within an auditable and enforceable policy structure.

A [Certificate Policy (CP)](policies-cp.md) defines the conditions under which certificates are issued, managed, and revoked within an ITS Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Certificate Practice Statements (CPS) provide the operator-specific implementation details that must align with the CP. Together, these documents establish the governance, approval criteria, and enforcement mechanisms that ensure certificates are only issued to eligible devices and entities, are used for authorized purposes, and can be revoked when necessary. Together, CPs and CPSs form the bridge between regulatory obligations (such as CRA or NIS2) and the technical enforcement of trust through PKI.

The structure of trust management varies by region. In North America, the Security Credential Management System (SCMS) uses a quorum of Electors to manage the Certificate Trust List (CTL) and to approve or revoke Root Certificate Authorities (RCAs). Each SCMS Provider operates under a CP that defines its responsibilities for certificate issuance, rotation, and misbehaviour report handling. SCMS Provider CPs must comply with SCMS Provider Requirements, as specified by the [SCMS Manager](https://www.scmsmanager.org/publications/). In Europe, the Cooperative ITS Credential Management System (CCMS) is managed centrally by a Certificate Policy Authority (CPA), which governs the European Certificate Trust List (ECTL). Root CAs seeking to be included in the ECTL must conform to the harmonized CP, and compliance is enforced through audit and assessment.

Both SCMS and CCMS models rely on CP/CPS documents to ensure that only eligible devices are authorized to participate in ITS communications, that certificates are properly managed across their lifecycle, and that misbehaviour can be detected and acted upon. This ensures that trust anchors remain valid and that the overall PKI ecosystem is resilient and interoperable across jurisdictions.

- C-ITS Credential Management System (CCMS) Certificate Policy (CP)  governs the issuance and lifecycle management of 1609.2 certificates within the CCMS. It defines how Root and Enrollment Authorities issue certificates, how revocation is managed, and how trust anchors are distributed. The CCMS CP establishes the minimum requirements for cryptographic algorithms, certificate validity, ITS Station enrollment, and operational practices to ensure interoperability and security of C-ITS applications. 
- SCMS Manager Provider Requirements – provide a template for SCMS Providers in North America to develop a CP that specifies how ITS-Stations are provisioned, how certificates are issued and rotated, and requirements for misbehavior reports and certificate revocation. 

### Technical Standards

Organizational frameworks and policy documents define the governance structure for cybersecurity in ITS. Technical standards implement these requirements at the protocol, device, and system level, ensuring that the policies described in frameworks, regulations, and certificate policies are realized in practice. These standards provide the specific technical controls needed for secure communications, device hardening, certificate management, and misbehaviour detection.

The following categories group ITS security standards according to their primary function:

- Edge Device Security Standards – define requirements for hardware security, secure boot, tamper detection, and cryptographic modules in OBUs, RSUs, and other ITS equipment.
- Network and Transport Security Standards – specify protocols for protecting confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of ITS data in transit.
- Application Security Standards – govern how ITS messages are formatted, signed, and validated to ensure interoperability and trust across jurisdictions.
- Security Management Standards – establish rules for security management and monitoring, certificate issuance, validation, revocation, misbehaviour reporting, and overall PKI operations.

#### Edge Device Security Standards

Use these standards to select, evaluate, or require hardware that supports key storage, secure boot, tamper detection, and cryptographic processing. This supports trusted execution and resilience at the component level.

#### Security Management Standards

Implement these standards to perform secure management of edge devices, and to issue, validate, and revoke certificates and to manage permissions.
